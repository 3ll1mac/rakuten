# Run locally

To run the React design, please type first in the rakuten directory:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

# Remarks
In the src/data.json file you will find a list of rakuten items. 
The first one was the given reference, and  the others are items that I created. The href and image link were not modified as I was not sure if you have chosen these links for a particular reason.

The last ones of the data.json file have errors and so, are not displayed.

# Possible Issue

If you can't load the images or click on the links, please remove "Protection renforc√©e contre le pistage" de la "Protection pour localhost" on your browser. It should solve the issue.
